# High Availability API Gateway on AWS

## Project Description

This project aims to design and implement a robust and highly available API gateway on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The primary goals are to achieve high availability, automatic failover, secure endpoints without authentication, and the ability to proxy 3rd party APIs through the same gateway.

## Solution Overview

### High Availability
To ensure high availability, we employ a multi-region setup with AWS Global Accelerator. By distributing our API endpoints across multiple AWS regions, we minimize the risk of downtime due to region-specific outages.

### Automatic Failover
Failover is a critical aspect of high availability. We utilize AWS Route 53 health checks and DNS failover to automatically route traffic away from unhealthy endpoints to healthy ones. This ensures minimal disruption in case of a failure.

### Secure Endpoints Without Authentication
We implement security at multiple layers. For public endpoints that don't require authentication, we use AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) to protect against common web threats. Additionally, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies are configured to control access at the API Gateway level.

### Proxy 3rd Party APIs
Our API gateway is designed to act as a reverse proxy for 3rd party APIs. This allows us to centralize API management, apply security measures, and monitor traffic to these external services.
