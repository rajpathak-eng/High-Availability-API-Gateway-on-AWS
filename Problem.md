**Problem**

Imagine you're developing a cutting-edge web application or service that needs to interact with various external services and APIs. You want to ensure that your application is always up and running, even if one of these external services experiences downtime. You also want to make sure that the communication between your application and these external services is secure, without the hassle of managing complex authentication mechanisms for each service individually.

**The Major Problem**

The challenge here is to design a solution that addresses these key issues:

1. **High Availability**: Ensuring your application is accessible to users around the clock, even when external services may face disruptions.

2. **Automatic Failover**: Creating a system that can seamlessly switch to backup resources or alternative services if the primary ones fail.

3. **Securing Endpoints without Authentication**: Implementing robust security measures to protect data and communication without requiring users to authenticate separately for each external service.

4. **Proxying 3rd Party APIs**: Establishing a unified gateway that acts as an intermediary between your application and multiple third-party APIs, simplifying communication and reducing complexity.

In essence, the major problem is to design a highly available, fault-tolerant API gateway on AWS that not only ensures continuous service but also maintains the security and integrity of data while acting as a versatile proxy for various third-party APIs.

Solving these challenges will result in a resilient and secure infrastructure that enhances the reliability and performance of your application while simplifying the way it connects with external services.
